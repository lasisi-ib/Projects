<p>Jupyter notebook and Python files, containing projects I have worked on as a learner in the field of Data science.
Most of these projects depicts my learning journey from beginner to where I am currently at.</p>

<p> <b>Data usage </b> Notebook is my only remaining notebook from the beginning, with the <b>Student</b> notebook as my latest notebook</p>

<p> <b>Note</b>: I am still in a learning phase, therefore most of these might not be like professionals but they show that i possess all basic skill required for basic data science activities </p>
